# Evaluate LoCs
Gather and analyze the lines of code across a set of repos.


This project provides a tool to gather and analyze the lines of code for a set of repositories and a
set of languages over a period of time.


## How it Works
Gather the lines of code e.g. via the cli tool `cloc` in combination and a `cronjob` or in
combination with git.


### Prerequisites & Dependencies
You need to have a running version of `Python 3`, `Jupyter`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.


## Customizing
You may customize the code, especially the `Jupyter` notebook and the `*.py` files. The `Jupyter`
notebook is intended to be extendend.


## Contributing
Work on your stuff locally, branch, commit and modify to your heart's content.
Happy coding!


## Known Issues
No known issues so far.


## TODO
- gittify the thing
- extend the README.md
- implement something
- add the scripts to gather the lines of code
- explain how to set up, especially the cronjob
