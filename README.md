# Evaluate LoCs
Gather and analyze the lines of code across a set of repos.

**THIS IS A DRAFT**


This project provides tools to gather and analyze the lines of code for a set of repositories and a
set of languages over a period of time.

TODO
The project is structured as follows:
```
.
├── .edmrc-sample               Example rc file.
├── explore-with-dmenu.sh       Main program.
├── LICENSE                     License definition.
├── README.md                   You are here now.
└── res                         Additional resources.
```


## How it Works
The lines of code may be gathered via the cli tool `cloc` in combination with a `cron` job.

## Installation
TODO


### Prerequisites & Dependencies
You need to have a running version of `Python 3`, `Jupyter`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.

TODO elaborate how to install this.


## Running
TODO


## Customizing
You may customize the code, especially the `Jupyter` notebook and the `*.py` files. The `Jupyter`
notebook is intended to be extendend.


## Contributing
Work on your stuff locally, branch, commit and modify to your heart's content.
Happy coding!


## Known Issues
No known issues so far.


## TODO
- gittify the thing
- extend the README.md
- implement something
- add the scripts to gather the lines of code
- explain how to set up, especially the cronjob
